# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„
Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This repo contains my solutions and progress for the Advent of Code challenges, as someone who started coding a few months ago. 

Advent of Code is an annual event where developers around the world solve coding puzzles every day throughout December, using their language of choice. Each day presents a new challenge, and I'll be trying to solve them using Python.
